# Objective:
The purpose of this assignment was to incorporate all of the new material we had been learning during lecture into this tic-tac-toe project. We were expected incorporate CSS, html, javascript and Bootstrap into the overall functionality and design of our projects. As displayed in the gif I was able to incoporate CSS to make the project aesthetically pleasing as well as provide player and computer functionality. 

# Final thoughts
During every step of the way I made sure to commit and push changes no matter how small to the github repository. This helped me with monitoring my changes alongside the liveserver that provided a real time view of the effect of said changes on my project. Overall, this was a fairly challenging assignment for me as this was my first true experience with js and bootstrap. I ran into a number of bugs and errors but was able to work through them makking this experience incredibly insightful.
